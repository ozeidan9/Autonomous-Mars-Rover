<h1>Autonomous Mars Rover</h1>

2nd Year EEE/EIE Group Project - 23rd June 2022
=======================================


This project aims to design and build an autonomous rover system for exploring an alien colony on

Mars. Autonomous rover systems have been vital for space exploration, especially in regions that are

dangerous for humans to navigate or difficult to access. A reliable autonomous system with minimal

human assistance is therefore necessary to collect data and navigate the Mars terrain. The following

report outlines the design and implementation of a rover that satisfies all the requirements to navigate

through the mars landscape.
